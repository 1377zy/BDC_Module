Implement Scheduled Reports Feature

This commit adds a comprehensive scheduled reports feature to the BDC Module, allowing for automated report generation and email delivery.

Key components:
- ScheduledReport model for storing report configurations
- ReportScheduler utility for generating and sending reports
- PDF generator using WeasyPrint for creating professional reports
- Email templates for report delivery
- CLI commands for checking and sending reports
- Task scheduler integration scripts for Windows and Unix systems
- Comprehensive documentation

The feature allows users to:
- Schedule reports to be generated daily, weekly, or monthly
- Customize recipients, date ranges, and report types
- Send reports immediately on-demand
- Toggle reports on/off
- Manage all scheduled reports through a dedicated UI

This implementation addresses the future enhancement opportunity mentioned in the reporting system documentation.
